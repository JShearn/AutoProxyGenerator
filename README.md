# AutoProxyGenerator
This library allows you to create proxys around concrete objects. You can then intercept calls to the object and carry out cross cutting concerns (such as data integrity checking, caching, logging etc.)
This is particually useful when you want to allow a third party to customize a component but still retain some control over how the component executes.
The scenario that I faced was when we had a WCF service that a third party could extend. We wanted them to be able to add new methods to the service but still intercept calls within the WCF client.
Because a WCF client is automatically generated by Visual Studio at design time you would have to rely on the third party creating a wrapper for each new method that they added, this isn't ideal.
Whilst this was originally designed for WCF clients it will work for most other concrete types that implement an interface.
